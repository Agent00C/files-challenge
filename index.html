		Hurao was a 17th century Chamorro chief in Guam who was instrumental in intitiating the Spanish-Chamorro war. He is most famous for his speech that united the Chamorro people to rise against the Spanish. It was the first time the people of Guam had organized against the Spanish. Hurao was killed in 1672 by a Spanish soldier, but the Chamorros continued to resist the Spanish for the next 20 years.
